 Write User Stories for the Messaging App
 
 ## Application Overview
This application is a text messaging platform that allows one-on-one communication between registered users. Any user who registers can send messages to other users without the need for friend requests or prior approvals. The application features a comprehensive list of registered users, which can be sorted in various ways, such as alphabetically or by the most recent interaction.

The messaging system allows free-form writing, enabling users to draft any message before sending it. To ensure the correct delivery of messages, the app provides status indicators showing whether a message was sent, received, and seen by the recipient. Additionally, when a user receives a message, they will be immediately notified via an alert within the app.

The application does not allow message editing or deletion, ensuring that conversations remain intact and unmodified, maintaining the integrity of the message history.

Regarding privacy and security, user registration requires email verification to confirm their identity. To avoid unwanted interactions, users have options such as muting notifications for specific chats or blocking other users to prevent them from sending further messages. These features ensure a straightforward, efficient, and user-controlled messaging experience.
